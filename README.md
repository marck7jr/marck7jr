## ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Marck here

Well, I don't know why and how, but I'm proud to see you here. So, let me introduce myself.

## ðŸ§¾ Public information

Hi! My name is Lucimarck Dias and I'm a brazilian developer passionate to learn. I currently live in Mato Grosso, Brazil and my actual work is to develop customizations and solutions to attend demands for LIMS-based systems.

In my free time, I like to learn new technologies and technics to improve my development skills, especially trying to create new apps for Windows using [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/).

## ðŸ”Ž Detailed information

* **Name:** Lucimarck Dias
* **Age:** 24
* **Living in:** Jangada, Mato Grosso, Brazil
* **Stack:** .NET - JavaScript - Azure
* **University:** Bachelor in Computer Information Systems by Federal University of Mato Grosso

## ðŸ‘€ Curiosities about me

* The first programming language that I learned was Pascal.

* I started to learn .NET without knowing the principles of object-oriented programming (and yes, it was painful, but these times are gone ðŸ˜…) just because I was a user of Windows Phone, so I started to learn how to build apps with Universal Windows Plataform - a framework to build apps targeting all devices based on Windows Runtime.

* I'm a Windows Insider Program member since the first public preview version of Windows 10, yeah since October 1st of 2014.

* I'm a huge fan of any software preview version because I feel that I adopt the new features faster than waiting for the public release and I must confess, encountering bugs never was a problem for me.

* I'm a huge fan of games too. God of War and Assassin's Creed franchises are my favorite ones.

* In 2012 I won my first PC and since I learned that my phone headphones were compatible with the P2 plug-in of my computer, I started to know new kinds of music and cultures, so since then, I'm a huge fan of heavy metal music, especially the ones that play with orchestrations. Dimmu Borgir, Septicflesh and Fleshgod Apocalypse are some of my favorite bands.
